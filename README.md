### Purpose of App

This is an app that takes inflammatory input and makes it into less inflammatory output. We hope we can use this app to make online arguments less toxic.

### How to run this app

Create a virtual environment (venv). Make sure you have Python, `streamlit`, `ollama` and (optionally) `openai` installed.

### Potential feature roadmap

At the moment this app can sometimes get stuck in Python path hell so **dockerizing the application** could be useful. Also we are looking at **usability improvements**.
